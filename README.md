# Inordinate Journey

Hi. We're Team Triangle.
Welcome to our class project for UCSC CMPM/ARTG 120 Spring 2018.

## Important license info

Before using any of our code, please take a look at LICENSE.md.
Although at least one of us is a proponent of FOSS,
it's a philosophy that doesn't apply well to some circumstances,
and a university class project is one of them.
We take our education seriously,
and plagiarism is a threat to the integrity of our work.
