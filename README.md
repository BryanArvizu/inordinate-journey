# Inordinate Journey

Hi. We're Team Triangle.
Welcome to our class project for UCSC CMPM/ARTG 120 Spring 2018.

## YO TEAM TRIANGLE READ THIs

Concio, Bryan, remember you guys! The audio files were too big
to fit on the repo and keep it small enough to download efficiently,
so we relocated them.

So, whenever you clone or download the repo fresh from scratch,
you'll have to get all the audio files from
[this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DchB7iDGFa6uyhD2mwipnPnNXuualeTm).
For them to work properly, you'll want to put all five files in /assets/audio.

IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THE AUDIOSPRITE FILES, THE GAME WILL NOT RUN.
I'm going to work on a fix for this, so that even if you forget this stuff,
you can still test or edit the game.

## Important license info

Before using any of our code, please take a look at LICENSE.md.
Although at least one of us is a proponent of FOSS,
it's a philosophy that doesn't apply well to some circumstances,
and a university class project is one of them.
We take our education seriously,
and plagiarism is a threat to the integrity of our work.
